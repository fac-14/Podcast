# Podcast
F&amp;C (FAC14) podcast planning etc!


## Rough notes
### Tasks to do
* site setup (and subdomain register)
* soundcloud pro setup [info 1 - step by step guide](https://creatorguide.soundcloud.com/podcasting), [info2](https://soundcloud.com/for/podcasting)
### EPISODE ONE to do
* Add intro mentioning purpose of podcast, "apologising" for audio etc; 
* mention of London/Nazareth/Gaza; 
* cut out a little bit around 11 mins in; 
* add/promise brief explanations of DOM, TDD, callbacks...
* Feedback address/form (podcast@foundersandcoders.com)
* Show notes with links to podcast recommendations, social media & posts explaining topics that came up (callbacks etc)

### Podcast ep 2 notes:
* Decide who's joining!
* Record "silence" (background noise) and chair squeaking sounds at start to use for noise removal
* Ensure it's actually recording!
* Intros, name game(?), what we've done since last ep (projects we presented, topics/tasks we've done), brief explanations of topics covered, random things learned/mistakes made, things we're proud of, how we're feeling about this week's project, up to 3 recommendations each of cool podcasts, websites, apps... (can be coding related but don't have to be), where to find us, what's coming next (podcast-wise)

### Podcast ep 3 notes
* Episode with Dan about the "Tech for better" site and offer?

## Audio processing notes
* Background noise(s) "removal" (reduction)
* Normalisation/compression
* Amplification, if still needed after compression
* EQ to remove extra low end, and reduce sibilance 
* Cut any slow/awkward moments, trim start/end
* Ending sound/music/whatver
